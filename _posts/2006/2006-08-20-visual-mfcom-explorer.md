<p>If you are like me, you have read the MFCOM documentation and found it pretty thorough. But, I found myself printing out screen shots of the Citrix Presentation Server Console and making notes of the various MFCOM properties that corresponded to the sections of the GUI. So, what I decided to do was share my notes in an electronic format. Thus, the Visual MFCOM Explorer was created. Visual MFCOM Explorer is a web application used to browse the various MFCOM properties using the Citrix Presentation Server Console as your guide. <br /><br /><img src="http://www.jasonconger.com/images/articleImages/VMFCOM/cmc.gif" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.jasonconger.com/VMFCOM/" target="_blank">Go to the Visual MFCOM Explorer website.</a> <br /><br />Note: this is a work in progress, but I decided to share what I have so far with the community.</p>
