Thanks to <a href="http://www.dpmworld.net/" target="_blank">Francesco Dipietromaria</a>, Web Interface for Resource Manager now has an Italian translation. That makes Web Interface for Resource Manager available in five languages:

If you are interested in providing a translation, feel free to send me an email. Even if you don't speak Italian, you might still want to download the latest version as it has a few minor bug fixes in it. Speaking of bug fixes, the next version of Web Interface for Resource Manager (version 3.0) has a few more bug fixes as well as some new features. Here is a list of some of the features that are in the works:

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Farm level reports</span> will provide statistics on a farm-wide basis.
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">ASP.NET AJAX enhancements</span> will provide UI and performance improvements.
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">MFCOM integration</span> will provide real-time application and server statistics.
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Citrix Presentation Server 4.5 configuration logging database integration</span> will provide reports on historical farm changes.

Hmm, I might have to rename this thing since it is starting to reach beyond Resource Manager. Until then, go get <a href="http://www.jasonconger.com/Web-Interface-for-Resource-Manager-2-2.aspx">Web Interface for Resource Manager version 2.2</a>
