The day 2 keynote this year is focused on things that are yet to come.  Traditionally, the first day keynote intermingled the "what's available now" stuff with the "what's coming in the next 6, 12, 18, <em>n</em>" months.  By breaking these things up into 2 days, it is a little more clear that what is shown today isn't readily available, but is more of the <em>direction</em> of Citrix.<!--more-->
