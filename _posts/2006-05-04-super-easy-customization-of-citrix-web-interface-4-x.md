<p><br />There are several resources out there explaining how to customize, or brand, Citrix Web Interface. The easiest method I&rsquo;ve found by far is to modify the layout.ascx user control. Using the technique outlined in this article, you can quickly give your Web Interface site a brand new look and feel.<br /><br /><span class="heading">The layout.ascx user control</span><br />The heart of the Web Interface layout is a file called layout.ascx. Layout.ascx is a user control that "constructs" the Web Interface authentication and applications page's HTML. There are two different layout.ascx files for every Web Interface site. These layout.ascx files can be found at <em>path_to_your_wi_site</em>\auth\include (login page) and <em>path_to_your_wi_site</em>\site\include (applications page).<br /><br /><strong>UPDATE:</strong> The layout.ascx files in Web Interface 4.6 are located at <em>path_to_your_wi_site</em>\app_data\auth\include (login page) and <em>path_to_your_wi_site</em>\app_data\site\include (applications page).<br /><br /><br /><span class="heading">Cutting layout.ascx to the core</span><br />To get started, open up the layout.ascx file located at <em>path_to_your_wi_site</em>\site\include. Next, strip out all the markup and code between the opening and closing &lt;body&gt; tags except the &lt;wi:Welcome runat="server"/&gt;, &lt;wi:MessageCenter&gt;, &lt;wi:Toolbar&gt;, and &lt;asp:PlaceHolder&gt; tags. These tags are the "meat and potatoes" of the Web Interface applications page. The &lt;wi:Welcome runat="server"/&gt; tag displays the welcome message. The &lt;wi:MessageCenter&gt; tag displays the message center. The &lt;wi:Toolbar&gt; tag shows the toolbar holding the refresh, settings, and help buttons. The &lt;asp:PlaceHolder&gt; tag shows all the published applications for the authenticated user.<br /><br />Note: it is not necessary to use any of these tags in your final markup although it would be pretty silly not to include at least the &lt;asp:PlaceHolder&gt; tag.<br /><br />The end result should look something like this:<br /><br /><code>&lt;body text="#000000" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" LINK="#000000" VLINK="#000000" ALINK="#000000" topmargin='0' leftmargin='0' marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" onLoad="onLoadLayout();" dir="&lt;%=getString("TextDirection", currentLocale)%&gt;"&gt; <br /><br />&lt;wi:Welcome runat="server"/&gt;<br />&lt;wi:MessageCenter runat="server"/&gt;<br />&lt;wi:Toolbar runat="server"/&gt;<br />&lt;asp:PlaceHolder id="ViewPlaceHolder" runat="server" /&gt;<br /><br />&lt;/body&gt;<br /></code><br />This produces a "bare bones" Web Interface page.&nbsp; Check it out:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.jasonconger.com/images/articleImages/WICustomize/bare-bones.gif" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.jasonconger.com/images/articleImages/WICustomize/bare-bones_small.gif" alt="Click to enlarge" /></a><br /><img src="images/magnify.gif" alt="" align="absBottom" /> <a class="enlarge" href="http://www.jasonconger.com/images/articleImages/WICustomize/bare-bones.gif" target="_blank">Click to enlarge </a><br /><br />If you would like a copy of this "bare bones" layout.ascx file, you can download it below:<br /><br /><img src="http://www.jasonconger.com/images/zip_small.gif" alt="" align="absBottom" /> <a href="/Downloads/layout_40.zip">layout_40.zip</a> (for Web Interface 4.0) <br /><br /><img src="http://www.jasonconger.com/images/zip_small.gif" alt="" align="absBottom" /> <a href="/Downloads/layout_42.zip">layout_42.zip</a> (for Web Interface 4.2) <br /><br /><img src="http://www.jasonconger.com/images/zip_small.gif" alt="" align="absBottom" /> <a href="/Downloads/WImods/layout_46.zip">layout_46.zip</a> (for Web Interface 4.6) <br /><br /><br /><span class="heading">Giving layout.ascx a facelift</span><br />Now, start adding your markup to the layout.ascx file and place the above mentioned tags where you want. If you want to modify text and color properties of the application links, the easiest place to do that would be the style.inc file located in the same place as the layout.ascx file. You can use this same technique for the layout.ascx file located at <em>path_to_your_wi_site</em>\auth\include to customize the login page.<br /><br />Note: if you need to grab the username and password of the authenticated user, check out <a href="http://www.jasonconger.com/How-to-get-the-Username-AND-Password-of-a-user-in-Citrix-Web-Interface-4-0.aspx">this article</a> for instructions on how to do it.<br /><br />Using the method described in this article, I made Citrix Web Interface look and feel like Microsoft SharePoint Portal Server 2003. Check it out below: <br /><br /><a href="http://www.jasonconger.com/images/articleImages/WICustomize/WISPS2003.gif" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.jasonconger.com/images/articleImages/WICustomize/WISPS2003_small.gif" alt="Citrix Web Interface with a Microsoft SharePoint look and feel" /></a> <br /><img src="http://www.jasonconger.com/images/magnify.gif" alt="" align="absBottom" /> <a class="enlarge" href="http://www.jasonconger.com/images/articleImages/WICustomize/WISPS2003.gif" target="_blank">Click to enlarge </a><br /><br />You may ask yourself, "Why would I ever want to do this?".&nbsp; Well, in this case the company was migrating from a custom written Intranet portal to Microsoft Office SharePoint Portal Server 2003 at the same time they were migrating from Citrix MetaFrame XP to Citrix Presentation Server 4.0.&nbsp; The SharePoint migration would take place after the PS4 migration.&nbsp; So, to minimize end-user impact, the custom portal was replaced with this SharePoint "fake-out".&nbsp; When the portal migration was ready, the front end never really looked that different to the end user, but the back end was vastly different.<br /><br />If you would like a copy of the templates I used to make Web Interface look and feel like SharePoint, you can download them <a href="http://www.jasonconger.com/Citrix-Web-Interface-SharePoint-Look-and-Feel-Template.aspx">here</a></p>
