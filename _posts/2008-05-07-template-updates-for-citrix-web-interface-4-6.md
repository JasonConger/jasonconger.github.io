In preparing for some <a href="http://www.citrixsynergy.com/home.htm" target="_blank">Citrix Synergy</a> and <a href="http://www.briforum.com/BriForum-2008-Chicago/" target="_blank">BriForum</a> sessions, I made some updates to the following two articles:

The [Super Easy Customization of Citrix Web Interface 4.x]({% post_url 2006-05-04-super-easy-customization-of-citrix-web-interface-4-x %}) article has been updated to include a "bare bones" template for Web Interface 4.6.

The [Citrix Web Interface SharePoint Look and Feel Template]({% post_url 2006-04-19-citrix-web-interface-sharepoint-look-and-feel-template %}) download has been updated to include a SharePoint look and feel template for Web Interface 4.6.

Feel free to use/modify these templates for your own use.
