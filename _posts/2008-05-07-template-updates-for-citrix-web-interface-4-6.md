In preparing for some <a href="http://www.citrixsynergy.com/home.htm" target="_blank">Citrix Synergy</a> and <a href="http://www.briforum.com/BriForum-2008-Chicago/" target="_blank">BriForum</a> sessions, I made some updates to the following two articles:

The <a href="http://www.jasonconger.com/Super-Easy-Customization-of-Citrix-Web-Interface-4-x.aspx">Super Easy Customization of Citrix Web Interface 4.x</a> article has been updated to include a "bare bones" template for Web Interface 4.6.

The <a href="http://www.jasonconger.com/Citrix-Web-Interface-SharePoint-Look-and-Feel-Template.aspx">Citrix Web Interface SharePoint Look and Feel Template</a> download has been updated to include a SharePoint look and feel template for Web Interface 4.6.

Feel free to use/modify these templates for your own use.
