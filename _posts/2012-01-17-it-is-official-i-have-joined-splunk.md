I am very happy to announce that I have officially joined the team at <a title="Splunk" href="http://www.splunk.com" target="_blank">Splunk </a>as a Solutions Architect.  As many of you may already know, my website is a place where I share a few articles and a lot of open-source code.  Most of the code I have distributed from this website is mainly focused on giving you insight into what is going on in your Citrix environments (Web Interface for Resource Manager, Web Interface Access Control Center, Configuration Logging, <a title="Project Raley" href="http://www.jasonconger.com/raley" target="_blank">Project Raley</a>, etc.)  Although I get ideas for these projects from the community and my own professional experiences, all of the code has been developed on my own personal time as a hobby and community contribution.
<h2>Turning a Hobby and a Passion into a Job</h2>
All that being said, joining Splunk allows me to turn a hobby and a passion into a full-time job.  On top of that, I get to work with a close friend, co-presenter, and fellow CTP/MVP <a title="Brandon Shell" href="http://bsonposh.com/" target="_blank">Brandon Shell</a> on a daily basis.  We will be working on building Splunk solutions around the Citrix Enterprise stack.
<h2>What Lies Ahead</h2>
This website is going to stick around and I’ll be writing more articles and open-source code.  I also plan on writing some Splunk articles here and on the official Splunk blogs.  I’m looking forward to what’s ahead!
