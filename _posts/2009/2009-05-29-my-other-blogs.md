When I first started this site, it was my goal to write technical articles and have a platform to distribute custom written software.  I think I have kept true to that, but that makes for sparse updates.  What you may or may not know is that I do contribute to 2 other blogs out there on a more regular basis:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://blogs.virtualizationadmin.com/conger/" target="_blank">VirtualizationAdmin.com</a>
<ul>
	<li>At <a href="http://blogs.virtualizationadmin.com/conger/" target="_blank">VirtualizationAdmin.com</a>, I focus mainly on virtualization news like Hypervisors, VDI, Application Virtualization, and surrounding technologies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
 
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://blog.xcentric.com/" target="_blank">blog.Xcentric.com</a>
<ul>
	<li>I just started blogging here (I currently work for <a href="http://www.xcentric.com/" target="_blank">Xcentric</a> as a system architect).  My goal with this blog is to focus on high level concepts surrounding virtualization, cloud computing, application delivery, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
 

I still try to keep this site focused on extending virtual environments.  What that means is I focus on tearing down software to get to the nuts and bolts and then try to figure out ways to uniquely extend the boundaries.
