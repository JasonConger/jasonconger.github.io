<p>I have been pretty busy lately preparing for <a href="http://www.briforum.com/europe/2006/" target="_blank">BriForum Europe</a> and have not had a lot of time to work on the site.&nbsp; But, I am close to releasing Web Interface for Resource Manger version 2.0 and&nbsp; I wanted to give you a "sneak peak" at the new features in version 2.0.<br /><br />Version 2.0 will contain:</p>
<ul>
<li>Concurrent application report</li>
<li>Concurrent session report per server</li>
<li>Server Metrics (with graphs)</li>
<li>Ability to export reports to Excel</li>
<li>More calendar filtering options</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some screen shots (remember, these are pre-release): <br /><br /><img src="http://www.jasonconger.com/images/articleImages/WIRM/v2.0/serversConcurrentUsage.gif" alt="" /> <br />Report showing max concurrent sessions per server and the date this max count was reached.<br />Notice the Excel icon that allows you to export the report.<br /><br /><br /><img src="http://www.jasonconger.com/images/articleImages/WIRM/v2.0/serversMetrics.gif" alt="" /><br />Report showing server metrics for a specified day.<br /><br /><br /><img src="http://www.jasonconger.com/images/articleImages/WIRM/v2.0/calendarFilter.gif" alt="" /><br />New buttons on the Sessions by Hour graph to show all sessions or just unique user sessions (filters out multiple sessions started by the same user in the same hour).<br /><br />Look for the official release of Web Interface for Resource Manager 2.0 shortly after <a href="http://www.briforum.com/europe/2006/" target="_blank">BriForum Europe</a>!</p>
