PowerShell is the new API for Citrix XenApp starting with version 6.&nbsp; Whether you want to write interactive applications or work with your XenApp farm via command line, you first need to set up the XenApp 6 PowerShell SDK.&nbsp; This post will step you through setting up the Citrix XenApp 6 PowerShell SDK in your environment.
<h2>Installing the Citrix XenApp 6 PowerShell cmdlets</h2>
Before we get started, you first need to download and install the Citrix XenApp PowerShell SDK (which includes the XenApp cmdlets). You can download the SDK here: <a title="http://community.citrix.com/display/xa/XenApp+6+PowerShell+SDK" href="http://community.citrix.com/display/xa/XenApp+6+PowerShell+SDK.">http://community.citrix.com/display/xa/XenApp+6+PowerShell+SDK.</a>

I recommend installing this on one of your XenApp 6 servers.&nbsp; Technically, you can install this on a workstation and use remoting to remote all the commands to a XenApp 6 server, but it is very messy and doesnâ€™t always work from my experience.&nbsp; Anyway, during the setup of the SDK, you will be asked to set the PowerShell execution policy to AllSigned.&nbsp; It is a good idea to leave this box checked to prevent malicious PowerShell scripts from ruining your day.

<h2>Adding the Snapins to your Runspace</h2>
After installation is complete, the assemblies will be loaded into the GAC (Global Assembly Cache).&nbsp; Every time you want to use the Citrix XenApp cmdlets, you will need to add the snapins to your PowerShell runspace.&nbsp; This can be done by launching PowerShell and using the Add-PSSnapin command as seen below:

Adding the snapins will allow you to execute all the XenApp cmdlets.&nbsp; Alternatively,&nbsp; you can launch PowerShell from the Citrix/XenApp Server SDK folder in the&nbsp; start menu as seen below.&nbsp; This will launch a PowerShell runspace with all the Citrix snapins loaded and ready to go.&nbsp;

You are now ready to start PowerShelling your Citrix environment.
